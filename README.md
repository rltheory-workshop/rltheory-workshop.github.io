# The second RL theory workshop (co-located with COLT 2024)

We would like to invite you\* to the second\*\* RL theory workshop, taking place 27-29 June 2024 at the University of Alberta (Co-located with COLT; COLT commences on the 30th of June). Schedule:
- Evening of June 27th: dinner and drinks
- June 28th: Full day of talks and discussions, some fun activity in the evening
- June 29th: First half dedicated to talks, second half to recreation and
winding-down before COLT

Please let us know if you intend to come by filling out [this](https://forms.gle/Q8hs1Kb8xXtFyd1f9) Google form.

We look forward to seeing you there,<br/>
*David Janz, Alex Ayoub \& Csaba Szepesv√°ri*
