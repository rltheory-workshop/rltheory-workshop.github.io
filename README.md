# The second RL theory workshop (co-located with COLT 2024)

We would like to invite you to the second\* RL theory workshop, taking place 27-29 June 2024 at the University of Alberta (Co-located with COLT; COLT commences on the 30th of June). Schedule:
- Evening of June 27th: dinner and drinks, 19:30 at the [Continental Treat Fine Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BYq4qY8ZkvmS5vwa6) on Whyte avenue.
- June 28th: 9:00-12:15 am talks; 12:15-14:15 sandwiches and posters; 14:15-17:45 pm talks.
- June 29th: 9:00-11:45 am talks; 12:15-14:45 pm talks; climbing/hiking and then pub.

The workshop is free to attend, but we cannot provide funding or accomodation.

We look forward to seeing you there,<br/>
